# Stock-Market-Data-Analysis:

Summary:
This project involves analyzing stock market data using Python, specifically leveraging the Pandas library for data manipulation and Matplotlib for data visualization. The goal is to provide insights into stock performance by calculating key metrics such as daily returns and moving averages, and by visualizing trends and patterns in the data. The project includes the implementation of Bollinger Bands to further enhance technical analysis of stock price movements.

Features:
Data Loading: Load stock market data from CSV files.
Data Cleaning: Handle and clean data to ensure accurate analysis.
Daily Return Calculation: Calculate daily returns based on the Last Traded Price (LTP).
Moving Averages: Calculate and visualize 50-day and 200-day moving averages to identify trends.
Bollinger Bands: Implement Bollinger Bands to assess market volatility and potential buy/sell signals.
Visualizations: Generate plots for daily returns, moving averages, and Bollinger Bands for comprehensive analysis.

Installation
To run this project, you'll need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

pandas
matplotlib
You can install the required libraries using pip:

pip install pandas matplotlib

Usage:
Clone the repository or download the project files.
Place your stock market data CSV file in the project directory.
Run the Stock_Market_Data_Analysis_Project.ipynb or analysis.py script to perform the analysis and generate visualizations.

Run : Run the analysis.py script to perform the analysis and generate visualizations : 
python analysis.py ( If you are doing it in VS Code (Only If you downloded .py file ) , otherwise directly run it in google colab if you downloded Stock_Market_Data_Analysis_Project.ipynb file

Sample Output:
The analysis will produce visualizations showing:

Daily returns of stocks over time.
The Last Traded Price (LTP) along with 50-day and 200-day moving averages.
Bollinger Bands representing price volatility.
